**Sort binary array in linear time**

Given a binary array, sort it in linear time and constant space. The output should print all zeros, followed by all ones.

For example,
Input:  { 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 }
 
Output: { 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1 }

**Approach**
1. counting 
2. replacing with 0
3. partitioning logic of Quicksort
