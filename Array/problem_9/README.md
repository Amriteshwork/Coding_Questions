**Maximum Product Subset Problem**

Given an integer array, find the maximum product of its elements among all its subsets.

For example,   

Input: ` nums[] = { -6, 4, -5, 8, -10, 0, 8 }`
 
Output: The maximum product of a subset is `15360`   
 
The subset with the maximum product of its elements is `{ -6, 4, 8, -10, 8 }`
 
 
 
- Input: ` nums[] = { 4, -8, 0, 8 }`
 
- Output: The maximum product of a subset is `32`
 
The subset with the maximum product of its elements is `{ 4, 8 }`
