**Sort an array in one swap whose two elements are swapped**

Given an integer array where all its elements are sorted in increasing order except two swapped elements, in-place sort it in linear time. Assume there are no duplicates in the array.

Input : `[3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 9]` or `[3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7]` or `[3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9]`   
Output: `[3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
